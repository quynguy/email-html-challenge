# Modern Design Agency - Email Template Challenge

This repository presents a challenge to recreate an email template for a fictitious design agency. 
It offers excellent practice in crafting and coding email templates and designs that are not only functional 
and visually appealing but also compatible across a diverse range of devices.

# Challenger Notes
1. Throughout this challenge, I utilized tr, td, and table elements to construct this email template. 
While these methods might appear outdated in comparison to contemporary web design practices, it remains a pragmatic choice for email development because it's predictable when rendering across various email clients.
2. Initially, I anticipated that grasping the syntax and structure of CSS inline styles might pose a challenge, given my familiarity with external or internal CSS files.
However, I found it surprisingly straightforward and easy to comprehend.
